Proxy Cache Purge
==================

This is the development repository for the Proxy Cache Purge plugin (formerly known as Varnish HTTP Purge).

You should install the plugin from the [WordPress.org Repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge/) however the master branch will mirror that. Development happens on various `REL` branches.

If you find a new theme or plugin with known conflict, please open a new issue in [Ipstenu/varnish-debug-service](https://github.com/Ipstenu/varnish-debug-service) and we'll update the master list.
