Varnish HTTP Purge

''THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD THIS PLUGIN FROM!''

Yes, I accept pull requests and stuff here, but if you're installing the plugin from this location directly, you're silly. This is where dev things live. 

Install the plugin from the [WordPress.org Repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge/) please and thank you.

## What is here?

* A beta copy of the plugin, for testing
* Language packs
* VCLs
