* Changed CURL to wp_remote_request (thank you <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatability-with-editorial-calendar-plugin?replies=1">Kenn Wilson</a>) so we don't have to do <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-varnish-http-purge-incompatibility-with-woocommerce?replies=6">CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER</a> Remember kids, CURL is okay, but wp_remote_request is more better.
