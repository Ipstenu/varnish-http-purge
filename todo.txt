We're going to sit down and look into how the plugin is structured to make it even faster and more organized. Please send coffee. Here's the wish list:

* Only purge all automatically once an hour (manual button click will continue to work)
* Refactor automated purge all to be kinder
* Reorganize code for sanity
* Get rid of the need to parse_url()
