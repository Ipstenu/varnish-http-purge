## Introduction

This project is a collection of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) rules (sniffs) to validate code developed for WordPress. It ensures code quality and adherence to coding conventions, especially the official [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).

## Project history

 - In April 2009 original project from [Urban Giraffe](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/wordpress-codesniffer-standard/) was published.
 - In May 2011 the project was forked on GitHub by [Chris Adams](http://chrisadams.me.uk/).
 - In April 2012 [XWP](https://xwp.co/) started to dedicate resources to develop and lead the creation of the sniffs and rulesets for `WordPress-Core`, `WordPress-VIP` (WordPress.com VIP), and `WordPress-Extra`.
 - In 2015, [J.D. Grimes](https://github.com/JDGrimes) began significant contributions, along with maintenance from [Gary Jones](https://github.com/GaryJones).
 - In 2016, [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl) began contributing heavily, adding more commits in a year than anyone else in 5 years previous since the project's inception.

## Installation

### Requirements

The WordPress Coding Standards require PHP 5.3 or higher and [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) version **2.9.0** or higher.
As of version 0.13.0, the WordPress Coding Standards are compatible with PHPCS 3.0.2+. In that case, the minimum PHP requirement is PHP 5.4.

### Composer

Standards can be installed with the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency manager:

    composer create-project wp-coding-standards/wpcs --no-dev

Running this command will:

1. Install WordPress standards into `wpcs` directory.
2. Install PHP_CodeSniffer.
3. Register WordPress standards in PHP_CodeSniffer configuration.
4. Make `phpcs` command available from `wpcs/vendor/bin`.

For the convenience of using `phpcs` as a global command, you may want to add the path to the `wpcs/vendor/scripts` (PHPCS 2.x) and/or `wpcs/vendor/bin` (PHPCS 3.x) directories to a `PATH` environment variable for your operating system.

#### Installing WPCS as a dependency

When installing the WordPress Coding Standards as a dependency in a larger project, the above mentioned step 3 will not be executed automatically.

There are two actively maintained Composer plugins which can handle the registration of standards with PHP_CodeSniffer for you:
* [composer-phpcodesniffer-standards-plugin](https://github.com/higidi/composer-phpcodesniffer-standards-plugin)
* [phpcodesniffer-composer-installer](https://github.com/DealerDirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer):"^0.4.3"

It is strongly suggested to `require` one of these plugins in your project to handle the registration of external standards with PHPCS for you.

### Standalone

1. Install PHP_CodeSniffer by following its [installation instructions](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer#installation) (via Composer, Phar file, PEAR, or Git checkout).

   Do ensure that PHP_CodeSniffer's version matches our [requirements](#requirements), if, for example, you're using [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).

2. Clone the WordPress standards repository:

        git clone -b master https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git wpcs

3. Add its path to the PHP_CodeSniffer configuration:

        phpcs --config-set installed_paths /path/to/wpcs

   **Pro-tip:** Alternatively, you can tell PHP_CodeSniffer the path to the WordPress standards by adding the following snippet to your custom ruleset:
   ```xml
   <config name="installed_paths" value="/path/to/wpcs" />
   ```

To summarize:

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git phpcs
git clone -b master https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git wpcs
cd phpcs
#PHPCS 2.x
./scripts/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../wpcs
#PHPCS 3.x
./bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../wpcs
```

And then add the `~/projects/phpcs/scripts` (PHPCS 2.x) or `~/projects/phpcs/bin` (PHPCS 3.x) directory to your `PATH` environment variable via your `.bashrc`.

You should then see `WordPress-Core` et al listed when you run `phpcs -i`.

##  Rulesets

### Standards subsets

The project encompasses a super-set of the sniffs that the WordPress community may need. If you use the `WordPress` standard you will get all the checks. Some of them might be unnecessary for your environment, for example, those specific to WordPress VIP coding requirements.

You can use the following as standard names when invoking `phpcs` to select sniffs, fitting your needs:

* `WordPress` - complete set with all of the sniffs in the project
  - `WordPress-Core` - main ruleset for [WordPress core coding standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/)
  - `WordPress-Docs` - additional ruleset for [WordPress inline documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/)
  - `WordPress-Extra` - extended ruleset for recommended best practices, not sufficiently covered in the WordPress core coding standards
    - includes `WordPress-Core`
  - `WordPress-VIP` - extended ruleset for [WordPress VIP coding requirements](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/code-review-what-we-look-for/)
    - includes `WordPress-Core`

### Using a custom ruleset

If you need to further customize the selection of sniffs for your project - you can create a custom ruleset file. When you name this file either `phpcs.xml` or `phpcs.xml.dist`, PHP_CodeSniffer will automatically locate it as long as it is placed in the directory from which you run the CodeSniffer or in a directory above it. If you follow these naming conventions you don't have to supply a `--standard` arg. For more info, read about [using a default configuration file](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Advanced-Usage#using-a-default-configuration-file). See also provided [`phpcs.xml.dist.sample`](phpcs.xml.dist.sample) file and [fully annotated example](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-ruleset.xml) in the PHP_CodeSniffer documentation.

### Customizing sniff behaviour

The WordPress Coding Standard contains a number of sniffs which are configurable. This means that you can turn parts of the sniff on or off, or change the behaviour by setting a property for the sniff in your custom `phpcs.xml` file.

You can find a complete list of all the properties you can change in the [wiki](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/wiki/Customizable-sniff-properties).

### Recommended additional rulesets

The [PHPCompatibility](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility) ruleset comes highly recommended.
The [PHPCompatibility](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility) sniffs are designed to analyse your code for cross-PHP version compatibility.
Install it as a separate ruleset and either run it separately against your code or add it to your custom ruleset.

Whichever way you run it, do make sure you set the `testVersion` to run the sniffs against. The `testVersion` determines for which PHP versions you will receive compatibility information. The recommended setting for this at this moment is  `5.2-7.1` to support the same PHP versions as WordPress Core supports.

For more information about setting the `testVersion`, see:
* [PHPCompatibility: Using the compatibility sniffs](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility#using-the-compatibility-sniffs)
* [PHPCompatibility: Using a custom ruleset](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility#using-a-custom-ruleset)

## How to use

### Command line

Run the `phpcs` command line tool on a given file or directory, for example:

    phpcs --standard=WordPress wp-load.php

- Note that certain items within PHPCS config file can cause linting to fail, see [linter-phpcs #95](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-phpcs/issues/95#issuecomment-316133107) for more details.

### Visual Studio

Please see "[Setting up PHP CodeSniffer in Visual Studio Code](https://tommcfarlin.com/php-codesniffer-in-visual-studio-code/)", a tutorial by Tom McFarlin.


## Running your code through WPCS automatically using CI tools

### [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

To integrate PHPCS with WPCS with Travis CI, you'll need to install both `before_install` and add the run command to the `script`.
If your project uses Composer, the typical instructions might be different.

If you use a matrix setup in Travis to test your code against different PHP and/or WordPress versions, you don't need to run PHPCS on each variant of the matrix as the results will be same.
You can set an environment variable in the Travis matrix to only run the sniffs against one setup in the matrix.

#### Travis CI example
```yaml
language: php

matrix:
  include:
    # Arbitrary PHP version to run the sniffs against.
    - php: '7.0'
      env: SNIFF=1

before_install:
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then export PHPCS_DIR=/tmp/phpcs; fi
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then export SNIFFS_DIR=/tmp/sniffs; fi
  # Install PHP_CodeSniffer.
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git $PHPCS_DIR; fi
  # Install WordPress Coding Standards.
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git $SNIFFS_DIR; fi
  # Set install path for WordPress Coding Standards.
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then $PHPCS_DIR/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths $SNIFFS_DIR; fi
  # After CodeSniffer install you should refresh your path.
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then phpenv rehash; fi

script:
  # Run against WordPress Coding Standards.
  # If you use a custom ruleset, change `--standard=WordPress` to point to your ruleset file,
  # for example: `--standard=wpcs.xml`.
  # You can use any of the normal PHPCS command line arguments in the command:
  # https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Usage
  - if [[ "$SNIFF" == "1" ]]; then $PHPCS_DIR/bin/phpcs -p . --standard=WordPress; fi
```
